<h2>What is it ?</h2>
<p>
    Shaders are the next front-end web developpment big thing, with the ability to create very powerful 3D interactions and animations. A lot of very good javascript libraries already handle WebGL but with most of them it's kind of a headache to position your meshes relative to the DOM elements of your web page.
</p>
<p>
    Curtain.js was created with just that issue in mind. It is a small vanilla WebGL javascript library that converts HTML elements containing images into 3D WebGL textured planes, allowing you to animate them via shaders.<br />
    You can define each plane size and position via CSS, which makes it super easy to add WebGL responsive planes all over your pages.
